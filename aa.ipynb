      "<s> the family history of poets ted hughes and sylvia plath took another tragic turn monday when it was revealed that their son had committed suicide after battling depression . poets ted hughes and sylvia plath had separated before their son 's first birthday . nicholas hughes , whose mother asphyxiated herself in 1963 by putting her head in a gas oven at her london home while her two children slept in the next room , hanged himself at his home in alaska , his sister frieda told the times newspaper . hughes , 47 , was unmarried with no children of his own and had until recently been a marine biologist at the university of alaska fairbanks . the times said that shortly before his death he had left his academic job to set up a pottery workshop at home . frieda hughes , a poet , author and artist , said in a statement to the newspaper : `` it is with profound sorrow that i must announce the death of my brother , nicholas hughes , who died by his own hand on monday march 16 , 2009 at his home in alaska . `` he had been battling depression for some time . '' she added : `` his lifelong fascination with fish and fishing was a strong and shared bond with our father ( many of whose poems were about the natural world ) . `` he was a loving brother , a loyal friend to those who knew him and , despite the vagaries that life threw at him , he maintained an almost childlike innocence and enthusiasm for the next project or plan . '' hughes was only a baby when his mother killed herself , and his father tried to shield his children from the intense public interest in the family . some feminist groups blamed the death on ted hughes , who had left plath for <unk> <unk> , the wife of another poet . six years later , <unk> gassed herself and their daughter shura in an apparent copycat suicide . ted hughes died in 1998 , the year he published birthday letters , a series of poems about his life with plath and her death . hughes appears in both of his parents ' poetry . in `` nick and the candlestick , '' published in plath 's posthumous collection `` ariel , '' she wrote : `` you are the one . solid the spaces lean on , envious . you are the baby in the barn . '' later his father wrote of how , after plath 's death , their son 's eyes `` became wet jewels , the hardest substance of the purest pain . as i fed him in his high white chair . '' frieda hughes has written about her parents and her own battles with depression but a family friend dismissed the idea that nicolas 's death fitted into a family trend . `` nick was n't just the baby son of plath\n"
